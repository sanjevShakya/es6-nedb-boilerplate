# Gait logger server

The peripheral software is written in NodeJs. The server implements different modules like
the serial listener, event emitter, application server, an HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
server to serve static frontend files, sockets to communicate with clients, and a database
to store the subjectsâ€™ details like name, age and height. The gait logger and the data logger
server are connected through serial. The client application and the server are connected using
TCP/IP protocol. The interprocess communication is bridged between the serial listener
and the application server using an event emitter API of NodeJS.
